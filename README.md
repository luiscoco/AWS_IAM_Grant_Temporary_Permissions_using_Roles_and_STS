# AWS IAM Grant Temporary Permissions using Roles and STS

In this hands-on exploration of AWS Identity and Access Management (**IAM**), I walked through how to **grant temporary, scoped permissions** to a new IAM user by leveraging roles and AWS Security Token Service (STS).

Steps covered: 

a) **Create** a new **IAM user**

b) **Define a custom IAM role** with a trust relationship

c) **Create a policy** to allow s3:ListAllMyBuckets access

d) **Attach** the **policy to the role**

e) **Create** a new Amazon **S3 bucket**

f) Assume the role and successfully **listed all S3 buckets**

This approach ensures least-privilege access while enabling secure, time-bound operations â€” a best practice for managing access in AWS environments.

## 1. We login in AWS Console

We login AWS Console with an Admin User different to the Root User
